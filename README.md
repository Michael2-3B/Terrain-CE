# Terrain-CE
Terrain CE is currently a TI-Basic experiment of mine in generating a height map and representing it like terrain in an isometric view.

Examples:

![Isometric Pyramid Terrain](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Michael2-3B/Terrain-CE/master/screenshots/pyramid.png)

The generator algorithm works by providing height values in a matrix that are no more than 1 higher or lower than the neighboring nodes.
The smoothing code afterwards removes one block dips and spikes.

There is also now a map editor in the program to make a custom heightmap! Check it out:
